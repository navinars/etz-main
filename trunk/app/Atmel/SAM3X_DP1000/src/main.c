	pvPortMalloc() is called internally by the kernel whenever a task, queue,
	timer or semaphore is created.  It is also called by various parts of the
	demo application.  If heap_1.c or heap_2.c are used, then the size of the
	heap available to pvPortMalloc() is defined by configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE in
	FreeRTOSConfig.h, and the xPortGetFreeHeapSize() API function can be used
	to query the size of free heap space that remains (although it does not
	provide information on how the remaining heap might be fragmented). */

	to block in any way (for example, call xQueueReceive() with a block time
	specified, or call vTaskDelay()).  If the application makes use of the
	vTaskDelete() API function (as this demo application does) then it is also
	important that vApplicationIdleHook() is permitted to return to its calling
	function, because it is the responsibility of the idle task to clean up
	memory allocated by the kernel to any task that has since been deleted. */
